Project Overview: The goal of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive data dashboard for a coffee shop that will provide real-time insights into order activity, inventory management, and staff operations. The dashboard will serve as a central hub for tracking key performance metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimise business operations and enhance overall efficiency.




Key Objectives:

Monitor Sales & Order Performance:
Track total sales and the number of orders to gain insights into customer activity.
Analyse sales by categories (e.g., beverages, snacks, etc.) to understand which items contribute the most to revenue.
Identify top-selling items and understand patterns of orders based on time of day (e.g., peak hours).
Calculate the average order value to gauge customer spending behaviour.




Optimise Inventory Management:
Monitor the quantity of each ingredient in stock, tracking total quantities and cost.
Calculate the cost of items based on ingredient use.
Track the percentage of stock remaining by item to prevent shortages.
Generate a list of ingredients that need replenishing, ensuring optimal stock levels for operations.




Manage Staff Efficiency:
Calculate total staff costs based on hours worked and hourly wages.
Track total hours worked per staff member to ensure fair distribution of shifts.
Analyse the cost per staff member to understand labour expenses and optimise scheduling.




Dashboard Sections:

Hours Worked by Staff Member: Display individual staff members' total hours worked over a given time frame.
Cost per Staff Member: Calculate the wage cost for each staff member based on hours worked.




Deliverables:

An interactive dashboard, accessible online, featuring all the above metrics.

A reporting mechanism that allows export of key metrics for offline analysis or team meetings.




Technology Stack:

Database: MySQL
Data Analysis & Visualisation: Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)
